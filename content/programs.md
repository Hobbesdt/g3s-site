We are building online and offline communities through the following initiatives:

- A Tumblr blog to curate stories, posts, and discussions that are relevant to our community so that we can learn from each other.
    - We are always seeking new contributors and content, so please [submit](http://gaysianthirdspace.tumblr.com/submit) any posts, new or old, that you think could fit this mission.
    - We regularly invite members of our community to guest curate our blog, where they showcase content matching a theme of their choice for a week.
    - We run a [Follower Fridays series](http://gaysianthirdspace.tumblr.com/tagged/followerfriday) to showcase the diversity of gaysians and to get to know each other better by featuring the profile of a member of our community every Friday. 
    - We run a [Writer’s Roundtable series](http://gaysianthirdspace.tumblr.com/tagged/askG3S/chrono) to facilitate and publish conversations on topics of interest to the community. If you have any topics you’d like the writers in our community to discuss, please [submit](http://gaysianthirdspace.tumblr.com/writers-roundtable) them to the Writer’s Roundtable!
    - Finally, we are [cataloging](http://gaysianthirdspace.tumblr.com/tags) our archives to make it easier to find content that speaks to specific topics and experiences.
- A moderated [Line group](http://gaysianthirdspace.tumblr.com/socialmedia) to facilitate closer interactions through chatting, serious discussions, and more casual conversations across many time zones.
- A [mentorship program](http://gaysianthirdspace.tumblr.com/mentors) for existing and new G3S community members to interact with, learn from, and support each other in a smaller group setting.
- In-person regional [socials](http://gaysianthirdspace.tumblr.com/tagged/g3s+social) to grow local communities through small offline spaces for friendship and conversation.
- An [Instagram account](http://www.instagram.com/gaysianthirdspace/) for sharing our experiences and learning from each other through a more visual medium. We are starting by sharing our Follower Friday profiles on the account, and we hope to eventually provide a community platform for visual storytelling.
- A [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/gaysianthirdspace) for facilitating more interactive discussions about the content posted to the Tumblr blog.
We encourage you to check out what speaks to you the most and then get involved there. If you have any questions, or if you’re interested in helping out with any of our initiatives, please message us [on Tumblr](http://gaysianthirdspace.tumblr.com/ask) or by email ([gaysianthirdspace@gmail.com](mailto:gaysianthirdspace@gmail.com))!
